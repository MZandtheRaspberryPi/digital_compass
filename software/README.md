# Calibrating

Datasheet [here](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST_BNO055_DS000_12.pdf) has section 3.10 on calibrating.

For accelerometer, "6 different stable positions for a period of few seconds to allow the accelerometer to calibrate."

For gyro: "Place the device in a single stable position for a period of few seconds to allow the gyroscope to calibrate."

For mag: "the steps mentioned below are to calibrate the magnetometer for hard-iron distortion (...) Compass, M4G & NDOF_FMC_OFF: Make some random movements (for example: writing the number ‘8’ on air) until the
CALIB_STAT register indicates fully calibrated."
